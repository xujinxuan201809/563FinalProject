# 563FinalProject
In this project, we develope a 3 layer and a 4 layer Neural Network in CPU and GPU and record the running time respectively. 
As for the data, we use the 42'000 Handwritten Images as our training data from the MNIST dataset. And each image has 784 dimensions. The batch size,the number of images input each time, is 256.

# CPU_3LAYER_500
The 3 layer neural network in CPU is builded with 500 and 500 units configuration.

# CPU_4LAYER_500
The 4 layer neural network in CPU is builded with 500 and 500 units configuration.

# Train.txt
This file includes 42000 handwritten images as training data for the each program.

# Execution
Download the "train.txt", "CPU_3LAYER_500", "CPU_4LAYER_500".

Before running the program, you have to do two things below.

First, you have to change the "train.txt" file path which should be the path in your computer manually in each program, specifically in the beginning of main function. 

Second, this program will generate a txt file including the results, so you have to change the result file path manually in wherever you want.
